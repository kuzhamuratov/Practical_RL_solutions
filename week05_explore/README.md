  * Note: UCB-1 is not for bernoulli rewards, but for arbitrary r in [0,1], so you can just scale any reward to [0,1] to obtain a peace of mind. It's derived directly from Hoeffding's inequality.

## Seminar
In this seminar, you'll be solvilg basic and contextual bandits with uncertainty-based exploration like Bayesian UCB and Thompson Sampling. 

You will also need Bayesian Neural Networks. You will need theano/lasagne for this one:
```
# either
conda install Theano
# or
pip install --upgrade https://github.com/Theano/Theano/archive/master.zip
# and then lasagne
pip install --upgrade https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne/archive/master.zip
```

Everything else is in the notebook :)
